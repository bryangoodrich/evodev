# gamejam

This package contains game launchers for any games I work on developing in a quick and dirty manner to explore game development and `pygame` development, in particular. 

The `snake` game includes AI extensions to train agents using an evolutionary (genetic) algorithm. 

Ideally, the agents will be something I can abstract better to include in multiple games so agents or agent classes can be attached to any game in `gamejam` for specific training: e.g., create a classic breakout game and add agent logic to it in a plug-n-play fashion.
