Evolutionary Algorithm and Game Development

This repo contains my sandbox for exploring AI code and game development in Python. As this evolves, I will spawn specific project repos for anything that becomes substantial. 

Included projects here include

## gamejam

This is a series of game experiments to get comfortable using `pygame`. In particular, I developed a snake game clone and then expanded it to include genetic mutating agents to play the game. I'll add my references to my inspirations on this one later. 

In addition to snake, I created a simple ballz game that serves as a "Hello, World!" for `pygame` to understand its basic components. I also have plans to explore this further by making a mouser game, to toy around with mouse controls and physics on the balls. Then I plan to create the classic breakout game to further explore game physics and managing game assets and their behaviors.

## pyzelda

Watching a tutorial on YouTube covering how to create this in Java, I decided to replicate it using Python and using functional programming paradigmns. Even within the `pygame` module, I have opted for using my own design patterns to better handle certain update features. This is a work-in-progress.
